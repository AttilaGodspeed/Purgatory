# # hungry fish warning (1)

# # lost fish (init=3, question=4, help=7-8, eat=9)
Small Fish: "Um... hello... I'm uh... can you help me?  I've been separated from my school, and I'm too scared to leave this seaweed."
Do you know where my school is?
Help the fish.
Eat the fish.
Old Fish: "I saw them nearby, they're just past those ruins."
Small fish: "Oh!  Thank you!  Um... I'll be going now, bye!"
With a quick snap you eat the lone fish whole.  Such is the way of fishes.

# # you've BEEN EATEN! (63)
You have been eaten.  You feel your life quickly leaving your body, and your soul returning to a now familiar place...
# # died the OG way (65-66)
Your body had finally reached its limits.  One last hurrah in the life of a fish.
As you fade into darkness and feel your soul begin to slip free, you hope you've made a good impression.
# # FISH INTRO! (68-72)
Awareness and memory sure into you all at once, slowly solidifying into something... different.  Very different.
You are a fish, and an old fish at that.  You body feels worn to the point of exaustion.  
You're not just how much longer it will last.
You're also thinking.  As a fish.  Do fish think?  Did you eat thinking fish before?
Your thoughts give way to your surroundings as you acclimate to your new senses.
