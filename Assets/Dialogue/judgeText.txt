# GOD OF DEATH
A presence spilts your mind with words, and the Cat God appears before you, apparently short on time.
"YOUR DEEDS WILL NOW BE JUDGED MORTAL..."
"YOUR SOUL SHINES.  YOU HAVE EARNED YOUR PLACE AMONG THE BLESSED MORTAL.  ENTER AND KNOW PEACE."
"YOUR SOUL DWINDLES UNDER THE BURDEN OF MISDEEDS.  THERE IS ONLY ONE USE FOR A SOUL SUCH AS THIS."
"BECOME MY SUSTINENCE. . . AND BE RENDERED UNTO OBLIVION."
