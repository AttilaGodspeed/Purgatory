The cat states at you intently.
# # Poison (32-34 =init)
You find your supply of poison next to the barrels of your recently harvested grain.  
 . . . and the bottle has a small leak.  You should probably check the barrels for contamination.
 Your carefully wrap the bottle and carry it with you.  
# # Barrels ( 36-37 =init, 38 =repeat)
These are the barrels full of your recently harvested grain.  You notice some cracks near the ground.
Upon looking closer you discover some of your pest poision has gotten on the grain.
This grain is contaminated, if anyone eats it they can become very ill.
# # Merchant (40-41 =init, 42 =question, 45 =yes, 46 =no, 47 =repeat)
The merchant waves to you.  Merchant: "Hello Farmer!  I see you've harvested some of your grain."
"The mill's running a bit short right now, so I can offer you a little more than usual today."
Sell your first harvest?
Sure!
It's not ready.
Merchant: "Fantastic!  I'll send someone to go fetch them shortly."
Merchant: "Not a problem, people will always need grain!  Just let me know when it's all ready."
Merchant: "Always a pleasure."
# # Scarecrow ( 49-50 =init, 51 =repeat)
This is the scarecrow that guarded your grain until you harvested it this morning.
Farmer: "No need to guard an empty field."  You pick up the scarecrow and carry it with you.
Farmer: "Excellent!  This should keep those birds away!"
# # Eaten Fruit (53-55 =init, 56 =question, 59 =poison, 60 =pRepeat, 61 =sc, 62 =scRepeat, 63 =scPlant, 64 =putP, 65 =last repeat)
A small flock of birds is currently eating the fruit off your fruit trees at an alarming pace and with great enthusiasm.
You will need some kind of deterent to keep the birds from eating all your fruit before you can sell it.
Farmer: "No! Go away! Go away! Shoo! Shoo!"
You have a couple of tools available, which do you use?
Poison.
Scarecrow.
You still have some pest poison left over.  Applying it to this half-eaten fruit should get the birds when they come back.
You think you last left the poison on the south side of the farmhouse.
Your scarecrow did a good job of guarding your grain field.  Now the grain's been harvested, you can move it here.
The scarecrow should still be in the harvested field, up by the market.
You plant the scarecrow firmly in the ground.
You carefully apply some poison to the half-eaten fruit on the ground.  Farmer: "There!  Those birds won't be a problem for long"
Farmer: ". . . hopefully they don't die on my field."
# # load-in text (67-70)
Decades of memory flash through your mind in an instant.  Memories of earth, and crops, and small profits.
You are a Farmer.  You have just harvested one of your fields, and hope to sell the grain.  
You're running short on money again . . . again?  Has this happened before?
The thought fades as you focus on the task at hand.  Sell the grain, then you can return to the farmhouse to sleep.
# # farm door question (72)

Farmer: "!"
Thief 1: "Hey, nice place you've got."
Thief 2: "Even better, I've heard it comes at a discount.  Hehe."
Thief 1: "Hehehe."
The thief expertly skewers you with his dagger.  Thief 2: "A big discount!"
The thief's strike was fatal, you rapily lose conciousness as you bleed to death.
Before you completely black out, you feel... lighter, as if a piece of you was beginning to float.
